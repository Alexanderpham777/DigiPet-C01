Dependencies

Usage  
Upon launching the application, users will see a virtual pet displayed on the screen.
The pet's happiness and food levels are displayed as progress bars.
Users can interact with the pet in the following ways:
Petting: Tap or swipe on the designated area to pet the pet.
Giving Treats: Press the "Give Treat" button to increase the pet's food level.
Dancing: Press the "Dance" button to make the pet dance. Press "Stop Dancing" to stop the dance animation.  

Note   
Users should monitor the pet's happiness and food levels to ensure its well-being. If either level reaches zero, the pet will enter a critical state and display a sleeping animation.  

Known Issues  
Sometimes the dance will not happen unless the bar is compelety zero, due to the image change being ties to the happiness and hunger bar.
Haptic feed back is a hit or miss due to ios functions or code errors.
  
Overall this will be further develop into a final project as this was the most fun project created in this course.
